	<h1>The role of the Public Accountant in the American Economy</h1>

	<p>An audit involves searching and verifying the accounting records and examining other evidence supporting the financial statements. By gathering information about the company and its enviroment, including internal control; inspecting documents; observing assets; making inquires within and outside the compnay; and performing other auditing procedures, the auditors will gather the evidence necessary to issue an audit report.</p>

	<a href="http://i.imgur.com/u5gdKIK.png?1"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u5gdKIK.png?1"> </a>

	<p>The definition of an attest engagement refers to reports arising from three forms of engagements - examinations, reviews, and the performance of agreed-upon procedures.</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>An <b>examination</b>, referred to as an <b><em>audit</em></b> when it involves historical financial statements, provides the highest form of assurance that CPAs can offer.</li>
  		<li>A <b>review</b> is substantially lesser in scope of procedures than an examination and is designed to lend only a limited degree of assurance</li>
  		<li> An <b>agreed-up procedures engagement</b> results in a report by the CPAs that describes those procedures and 	their findings.</li>
 	</ul>

	<p>For an examination or audit the level of assurance provided is high, the risk of material misstatement is low, & the nature of assurance in the report typically goes like this: "In our opinion...."</p>

<h3>A brief history....</h3>
	<p>Although the objectives and concepts that guide present-day audits were almost unknown in the early years of the 20th century, audits of one type or another have been performed throughout the recorded history of commerce and government finance. In the first half of the 20th century, the direction of audit work tended to move away from fraud detection toward a new goal of determining whether financial statements gave a full and fair picture of financial position, operating results, and changes in financial position. This shift in emphasis was a response to the increasing number of shareholders and the corresponding increased size of corporate entities. Beginning in the 1960s, the detection of large-scale fraud assumed a larger role in the audit process. Professional standards, which used the term <i>irregularities</i> in place of fraud, described fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets.his shift in emphasis to taking a greater responsibility for the detection of fraud resulted from (1) a dramatic increase in congressional pressure to assume more responsibility for large-scale frauds, (2) a number of successful lawsuits claiming that fraudulent financial reporting (management fraud) had improperly gone undetected by the independent auditors, and (3) a belief by public accountants that audits should be expected to detect material fraud.</p> 

	<p>A factor overlaying a number of changes has been fast-paced changes in information technology.</p>

<h3>The Accounting Profession's Credibility Crisis</h3>
	<h4>Examples Include</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Enron</li>
			<p>"In December 2001, Enron Corporation filed for bankruptcy shortly after acknowledging that accounting irregularities had been used to significantly inflate earnings in the current and preceding years."</p>
		<li>WorldCom</li>
			<p>"WorldCom reported over $11 billion in accounting irregularities, completely eliminating the company's previously reported profits for all of 2000 and 2001 and causing the company to declare bankruptcy. At one time WorldCom had reported total assets in excess of $100 billion and a market value in excess of $150 billion, making it then the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history."</p>
	</ul>
	<p>By the summer of 2002, Congress had passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which toughened penalties for corporate fraud, restricted the kinds of consulting CPAs can perform, and created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</p> 

<h3>Types of Audits</h3>
	<h4>There are 3 main types of audits</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Financial</li>
			<p>The goal of a financial audit is to determine if the financial statements have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
			<li>Complience</li>
			<p>A example of a complience audit is an income tax return audited by an auditor of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These audits address whether a tax return is in compliance with tax laws and IRS regulations.</p>
			<li>Operational</li>
			<p>"An operational audit An analysis of a department or other unit of a business or governmental organization to measure the eff ectiveness and efficiency of operations. is a study of a specific unit of an organization for the purpose of measuring its performance."</p>
		</ul>
<h3>Types of Auditors</h3>
	<h4>As well as CPAs who typcially audit financial statements, there are a few other types of auditors.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Internal Auditors</li>	
			<p>"A principal goal of internal auditors is to investigate and appraise the effectiveness with which the various organizational units of the company are carrying out their assigned functions." "The internal auditing staff often reports to the audit committee of the board of directors and also to the president or another high-level executive." It would generally not be good for the internal auditing staff to be under the authority of the head accountant in order to maintain independant controls.</p>
			<li>Government Accountability Office Auditors</li>
			<p>"Congress has long had its own auditing staff, headed by the comptroller general and known as the Government Accountability Office, or GAO." "The enormous size of many of the federal agencies has caused the GAO to stress the development of computer auditing techniques and statistical sampling plans. Its pioneering in these areas has led to the recognition of the GAO as a sophisticated professional auditing staff."</p>
			<li>Internal Revenue Agents</li>
			<p>"The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for enforcement of the federal tax laws." "Although IRS audits include some simple individual tax returns that can be completed in an hour or so in an IRS office, they also include field audits of the nation's largest corporations and often involve highly complex tax issues."</p>
		</ul>
<h4>The Public Accounting Profession</h4>
	<p>"Each state recognizes public accountancy as a profession and issues the certificate of <strong>certified public accountant</strong>. A person licensed by the state to practice public accounting as a profession, based on having passed the Uniform CPA Examination and having met certain educational and experience requirements.. The CPA certificate is a symbol of technical competence. This official recognition by the state is comparable to that accorded to the legal, medical, and other professions.</p>	
<h3>American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</h3>
<h4>AICPA is a national organization of CPAs engaged in promoting high professional standards to ensure that CPAs serve the public best interest. The AICPA focuses on 4 areas....</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Establishing standards and rules to guide CPAs in their conduct of professional services.</li>
		<li>Carrying on a program of research and publication.</li> 
		<p>Publications to check out include: Journal of Accoutancy & The Tax Advisor, both published monthly. Also Accounting Trends & Techniques which is an annual study of current reporting practices of 600 large corporations.</p> 
		<li>Promoting continuing professional education.</li> 
		<li>Contributing to the profession's self-regulation.</li>	
	</ol>
	<p>"Throughout its existence, the AICPA has contributed enormously to the evolution of generally accepted accounting principles as well as to the development of professional standards. However, with the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the AICPA's influence and responsibility have been significantly diminished."</p>
<h3>The CPA Exam</h3>
<h4>The CPA exam is a uniform examination administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</h4>
	<ol>
	 	<p>The CPA exam is four parts:</p>
		<li>Auditing & Attestation</li>
		<li>Financial Accounting & Reporting</li>  	
		<li>Regulation</li> 	
		<li>Business Environment & Concepts</li>	
	</ol>

<h3>Organization of the Public Accounting Profession</h3>
<h4>Public accounting firms range in size from one to over 100,000.</h4> <p>Firms are often grouped into four categories: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Local firms - Local firms typically have one or two offices, include only one CPA or a few CPAs as partners, and serve clients in a single city or area.</li>
		<li>Regional firms - Many local firms have become regional firms by opening additional offices in neighboring cities or states and increasing the number of professional staff.</li>
		<li>National firms - Public accounting firms with offices in most major cities in the United States are called national firms.</li>
		<li>Big 4 firms - In alphabetical order, the four firms are Deloitte & Touche LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, KPMG LLP, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Since only a very large public accounting firm has sufficient staff and resources to audit a giant corporation, these firms audit nearly all of the largest American corporations.</li>
	</ul>	
<h3>Responsibilities of the Professional Staff</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Partners - The lead partner on an engagement is responsible for assuring that the audit is performed in accordance with applicable professional standards.</li>
		<li>Managers - A manager may be responsible for supervising two or more concurrent audit engagements.</li>
		<li>Senior Auditors - On a smaller engagement, the senior auditor may assume responsibility for planning and conducting the audit and drafting the audit report, subject to review and approval by the manager and partner. On larger engagements a senior auditor may assume responsibility for supervising some aspect of the audit, such as the audit of accounts receivable.</li>
		<li>Staff Assistants - The first position of a college graduate entering the public accounting profession is that of staff assistant.</li>
	</ul>

<h1>Professional Standards</h1>

<p>This chapter includes discussions of auditing standards, attestation standards, quality control standards and, to a limited extent, ethical standards.</p>

<h4>AICPA Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</h4>
<p>The auditors have a personal responsibility to have appropriate competence, comply with ethical requirements, and maintain professional skepticism and professional judgment.</p>

<p>The Statements on Auditing Standards (SASs) provide a variety of specific auditing requirements and guidance to be considered by auditors.</p> 
<p>SASs ordinarily include the following sections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduction, including scope.</li>
		<li>Objective(s).</li>
		<li>Definitions of important terms.</li>
		<li>Requirements.</li>
		<li>Application and other explanatory material.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Throughout the audit the auditors should be alert for:</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>Audit evidence that contradicts other audit evidence.</li>
  		<li>Information that raises a question about the reliability of documents and responses to inquiries.</li>
  		<li>Conditions indicating possible fraud.</li>
  		<li>Circumstances suggesting the need for additional audit procedures beyond those ordinarily required.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Auditors' work when performing an audit result in their being able to obtain reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the financial statements follow the applicable financial reporting framework. Accordingly, the auditors express an opinion on the financial statements, not a statement of fact.</p>

<h3>PCAOB Auditing Standards</h3>
<h4>The PCAOB Auditing Standards are structured around the following standards that the AICPA standards previously referred to as the 10 generally accepted auditing standards.</h4>

<h2>The Auditors' Responsibility for Detecting Misstatements</h2>
<h4>the auditors have a responsibility to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.2 Reasonable assurance is achieved when audit risk. The risk that the auditors may unknowingly fail to appropriately modify their opinion on financial statements that are materially misstated., the risk that the auditors may unknowingly fail to appropriately modify the opinion on financial statements that are materially misstated, is at an acceptably low level.</h4>

<h3>Errors and Fraud</h3>
<p>Auditing standards define errorsAn unintentional misstatement of financial statements or omission of an amount or a disclosure. as unintentional misstatements or omissions of amounts or disclosures in the financial statements.</p>
<p> For financial statement audits, "fraud" includes two types of intentional misstatements of financial statements - misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets. Legally, fraud is the misrepresentation by a person of a material fact, known by that person to be untrue or made with reckless indifference as to whether the fact is true, with intent to deceive and with the result that another party is injured.</p>
<p>The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is ordinarily higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error.</p>

<h3>Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h3>
<h4>Certain laws have a direct effect on the financial statements in that they determine the reported amounts and disclosures in those statements. Noncompliance with these laws results in the need for accounting journal entries.</h4>

<h2>Auditors Reports</h2>
	<h4>The end product of an audit of a business entity is a report expressing the auditors' opinion on the client's financial statements.</h4>
	<h3>Nonpublic Company Audit Reports-Standard</h3>
	<h4>The auditors' report for a nonpublic company begins with a title that includes the word "independent" and is addressed to the person or persons who retained the auditors.</h4>
	<a href="http://imgur.com/WJnN7f0"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WJnN7f0.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a>
	<p>What Is "Material"? In the audit of a small client - such as a condominium property owners' association - $1,000 might be considered material. On the other hand, in the audit of a company such as IBM or Microsoft, an amount of $10 million might be considered immaterial.he auditor who raises objections over immaterial items will soon lose the respect of both clients and associates. On the other hand, the auditor who fails to identify and disclose material deficiencies in financial statements may be liable for the losses of those who rely upon the audited statements. In short, applying the concept of materiality is one of the most complex problems faced by auditors.</p>
	<h3>Public Company Audit Reports-Unmodified (Unqualified)</h3>
	<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that auditors of publicly traded (issuer) companies in the United States perform an integrated audit that includes providing assurance on both the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.</p>
	<a href="http://imgur.com/LJLD2in"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LJLD2in.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a>
	<h3>Other Types of Auditors' Reports</h3>
	<p>A report with an unmodified ("unqualified" per PCAOB standards) opinion is the type of report the client ordinarily wants. Auditors may also issue a report with a qualified opinion. an adverse opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion.</p>
<h2>The Attestation Standards</h2>
<a href="http://imgur.com/9tjAYw7"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9tjAYw7.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a>
<h2>Quality Control in CPA firms</h2>
<h2>Regulation of Accounting Firms</h2>
<h2>International Accounting and Auditing Standards</h2>
<p> The international reporting model allows the auditors certain reporting options. As an example, instead of indicating that the financial statements “present fairly, in all material respects,” the auditors may substitute the phrase “give a true and fair view,” as required of auditors in the United Kingdom. </p>
