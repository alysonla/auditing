<h2>Background on Independence and the AICPA Conceptual Framework for Independence Standards</h2>

<a href="http://imgur.com/HLxvXVp"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HLxvXVp.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a>

<p>These terms are important because for an individual CPA any direct financial interestA personal investment under the direct control of the investor. The Code of Professional Conduct prohibits CPAs from having any direct financial interests in their attest clients. Investments made by a CPA’s spouse or dependents also are regarded as direct financial interests of the CPA. in an attest client impairs independence, while only a material indirect financial interestAn investment in which the specific investment decisions are not under the direct control of the investor. An example is an investment in a professionally managed mutual fund. The Code of Professional Conduct allows CPAs to have indirect financial interests in attest clients, as long as the investment is not material in relation to the CPA’s net worth. impairs independence. </p>

<h2>Analysis of Independence</h2>

<a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s126/sh/6e71f184-3c6f-464b-8ea4-35c003550b4d/f67fcadccb9133650150fdaeff909873"><img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s126/sh/6e71f184-3c6f-464b-8ea4-35c003550b4d/f67fcadccb9133650150fdaeff909873"/></a>

<p>The independence rule does not apply to all services performed by public accountants. CPAs perform a host of services in which the client is the major beneficiary and which do not require independence, such as management consulting, tax, and accounting services.</p>

<h3>Whats a covered member?</h3>
<p>A covered member efers to an individual, firm, or entity that is capable of influencing an attest engagement and includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An individual on the attest engagement team.</li>
		<li>An individual in a position to influence the attest engagement -i.e. partner who directly supervises the partner who is in charge of the attest engagement.</li>
		<li>A partner in the office in which the partner in charge of the attest engagement primarily practices in connection with the attest engagement.</li>
		<li>Certain partners or managers who provide nonattest services to the client.</li>
		<li>The public accounting firm, including its employee benefit plan.</li>
		<li>Any entity controlled by one or more of the above.</li>
	</ul>


<p>Past Due Professional Fees   If fees owed by a client to a public accounting firm become long overdue, it may appear that the firm's prospects for collection depend upon the nature of the CPAs' report on the current financial statements. Thus, the public accounting firm's independence is considered impaired if fees for professional services rendered in prior years have not been collected before issuance of the CPAs' report for the current year.</p>

<h2>Ethics for Internal Auditors</h2>
<p>
Internal auditors, acting through their national organization, The Institute of Internal Auditors, have developed their own code of professional ethics.</p>

<h2>Auditors’ Common Law Liability to Third Parties</h2>

<p>Clients have recourse against auditors for damages caused by an improper audit through both breach of contract and tort actions against the auditors. But what about the many third parties who rely upon audited financial statements? How may these parties recover their losses from auditors who have performed an improper audit?</p>
